Objective :
To perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python in order to understand data distributions, categorical behavior, outliers, correlations, and important features.

Datasets Used :

Netflix Movies and TV Shows
Iris Dataset

Tools & Libraries :

Python
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn

EDA Techniques Used  :

Histograms for numerical features
Count plots for categorical features
Box plots for outlier detectio
Correlation heatmaps
Feature importance identification
Summary of insights

Dataset Overview :                                                                                                                                                                                                                           

 Netflix Movies and TV Shows :

Records: 8,807
Features: 12
Key Columns: type, rating, release_year, duration, listed_in
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Iris Dataset  :

Samples: 150
Species: 3
Features: SepalLength, SepalWidth, PetalLength, PetalWidth

Exploratory Data Analysis Summary :

 Numerical Feature Distribution :

Netflix: Histogram of release_year shows rapid growth after 2010
Iris: Histograms show clear separation between petal features

Categorical Feature Analysis :

Netflix: Movies are more common than TV Shows; TV-MA and TV-14 dominate
Iris: All three species are evenly distributed

Outlier Detection :

Netflix: Movie duration shows a few extreme outliers
Iris: Minor outliers observed in SepalWidth

Correlation Analysis :

Netflix: Limited correlation due to mostly categorical data
Iris: Strong correlation between PetalLength and PetalWidth 

Important Features Identified :

Netflix Dataset :

type
rating
release_year
duration
listed_in

Iris Dataset :

PetalLength
PetalWidth
SepalLength

Conclusion :

This task demonstrates the importance of Exploratory Data Analysis in understanding datasets before applying machine learning models. Using both Netflix and Iris datasets helped in gaining practical experience with different data types and visualization techniques.# task---3
